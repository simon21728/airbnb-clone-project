# airbnb-clone-project


## Team Roles

In order to successfully build and maintain the AirBnB Clone project, the project team will include the following roles:

- **Backend Developer**  
  Responsible for implementing the server-side logic, creating APIs, handling authentication, and ensuring that the application’s backend functions correctly with the database and front-end.

- **Front-End Developer**  
  Responsible for designing and implementing the user interface, ensuring a responsive and intuitive experience, integrating APIs from the backend, and handling client-side functionality.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Manages the database, including designing schemas, optimizing queries, ensuring data integrity, and handling backups and migrations.

- **DevOps / Deployment Engineer**  
  Responsible for deployment, server configuration, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and monitoring the application in production.

- **Project Manager**  
  Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team members, manages tasks, and ensures that milestones are met.

- **QA / Tester**  
  Tests the application for bugs, performance issues, and ensures that features meet the project requirements and quality standards.

## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project leverages a variety of technologies to build a full-featured, responsive, and scalable application:

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend, handling business logic, user authentication, and creating RESTful APIs with Django REST Framework.  

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django, providing serialization, authentication, and easy handling of HTTP requests.  

- **React**: A JavaScript library used for building the front-end user interface, creating dynamic and responsive web pages, and interacting with the backend APIs.  

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system used to store and manage the project’s data, including user accounts, property listings, bookings, and reviews.  

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core front-end technologies used to structure, style, and add interactivity to web pages.  

- **Git & GitHub**: Version control system and repository hosting service used to manage the project’s source code, track changes, and collaborate with team members.  

- **Heroku / AWS (optional)**: Cloud platforms used to deploy the application and make it accessible to users online.


## Database Design

The AirBnB Clone project will include the following key entities:

- **Users**  
  Fields: `id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `is_host`  
  - Each user can act as a guest or a host.  
  - A user can have multiple properties (if they are a host) and multiple bookings (as a guest).  

- **Properties**  
  Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `host_id`  
  - Each property is owned by a host (user).  
  - A property can have multiple bookings and multiple reviews.  

- **Bookings**  
  Fields: `id`, `property_id`, `guest_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_price`  
  - A booking belongs to a single property and a single guest (user).  

- **Reviews**  
  Fields: `id`, `property_id`, `guest_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`  
  - Reviews are associated with a property and the guest who left the review.  

- **Payments**  
  Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `payment_date`  
  - Each payment is linked to a booking and records the transaction details.  

### Relationships
- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (as a host).  
- A **User** can have multiple **Bookings** (as a guest).  
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** and **Reviews**.  
- Each **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **Guest (User)**.  
- Each **Payment** is associated with a single **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**  
  Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can act as guests or hosts, enabling them to book properties or list their own properties for rent.  

- **Property Management**  
  Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings, including details such as title, description, location, price, and images. This feature allows the application to maintain an up-to-date catalog of available properties.  

- **Booking System**  
  Enables guests to book available properties for specified dates. The system calculates the total price, manages availability, and ensures that bookings do not overlap.  

- **Review and Rating System**  
  Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature helps maintain trust and provides valuable feedback for hosts and future guests.  

- **Payment Processing**  
  Handles payments for bookings, including recording transaction details and managing payment statuses. This ensures secure and reliable handling of financial transactions.  

- **Search and Filter**  
  Allows users to search for properties by location, price, availability, and other criteria. This feature improves user experience by helping guests find the most suitable listings quickly.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is crucial to protect user data, maintain trust, and ensure the integrity of the application. The following key security measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Users must log in to access protected endpoints. This ensures that only registered users can perform actions such as booking properties, leaving reviews, or managing listings.  

- **Authorization**  
  Access control is enforced so that users can only perform actions they are permitted to. For example, only a host can update or delete their own properties, and only the guest who made a booking can cancel it.  

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given period. This helps prevent abuse, DDoS attacks, and reduces server overload.  

- **Data Validation and Sanitization**  
  All input data is validated and sanitized to prevent malicious data from causing security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection or XSS attacks.  

- **Secure Payment Handling**  
  Payment information is handled securely using encryption and third-party payment gateways. This protects sensitive financial data and ensures safe transactions.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. They help ensure that code changes are integrated smoothly, tested automatically, and deployed reliably to production or staging environments.

**Importance for the Project:**  
- Reduces the chance of introducing bugs or breaking existing features.  
- Speeds up development by automating testing and deployment.  
- Ensures consistent and reproducible builds across environments.

**Tools that could be used:**  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates builds, tests, and deployments directly from the repository.  
- **Docker**: Packages the application and its dependencies into containers for consistent deployment.  
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean**: Cloud platforms for deploying and hosting the application.  
- **pytest / Django Test Framework**: For automated testing as part of the CI pipeline.
